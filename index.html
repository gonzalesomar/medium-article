    <p> Back in 2013, S√©bastien, my brother Romain and
      I decided to launch a coding school to teach creative
      and entrepreneurially-minded people how to code their
      own tech products through an intensive 9-week bootcamp.
      At that time, none of us had real design or branding skills.
      My brother was a lawyer. S√©bastien and I were both engineers
      (French engineers, aka the worst kind in terms of design
      background üò¨).
    </p>
    <p>
      We only knew one thing: we wanted to build a program
      to teach people the technical skills and tools to bring
      their ideas to life. This program would go far beyond
      ‚Äúbecoming a full-stack developer‚Äù or ‚Äúlearning UX/UI Design,
       HTML, CSS, ruby and Javascript‚Äù. For us, these skills were
       also a prerequisite for anyone who wanted to develop tech
       projects autonomously in their current job, start a
       freelancing career or launch their own startup. And we felt
        that traditional degrees‚Äô courses were failing to provide
        students with these new tech skills. As we say in French‚Ä¶

    <h2> Shipping our first logos üôà </h2>
    <p> After a few drawings on a sheet of
      paper with a designer friend Julien, we quickly
       realized that a wagon is a poor design object üò¨: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> It has no beginning. No end. No movement to it. </li>
      <li> It makes you think about underground, work, mine, gold rush, etc‚Ä¶ not exactly the images we had in mind for our brand! </li>
    </ul>

    <p> So, at this point, we just thought: </p>
